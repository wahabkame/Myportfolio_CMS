            I am Wahab kame , Enginnering Student 
        </span>Â 
        
        I am currently a Front-End Engineer As part time only remote ,
        The high-speed and fast-changing environment of the Work market
        pushes me to constantly learning new technologies and tools that 
        break out of my comfort zone. In addition, besides coding, 
        I can work collaboratively with the design team, bringing my 
        perspective and knowledge into it.

        My ambition is to create positive value through the 
        fusion of technology and design. I am very enthusiastic
        about working hands-on in innovative projects, crafting 
        solutions for a positive impact. I strongly believe in the
        power of making. I am a thinker and doer, passionate about 
        shaping abstract ideas into tangible realities of all kinds and forms.
        I love tackling challenges from an experience-driven and creative approach,
        designing a better tomorrow.

    I believe a successful product is one that adds value to 
    all who relate to it. From a Developer's perspective,
    a successful product is the outcome of teamwork and a 
    learning journey across the design process. 
    From an object's point of view, it is successful when 
    using it doing good, having a positive impact on people's life.
    If people keep choosing it yet the freedom of having other
    options, then its experience is a success. The product outstands if it 
    contributes to a better society. Last but not least, the product is
    successful when it takes care not only of people but of the world, 
    being sustainable and world-friendly.
